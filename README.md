# graph_presenter
Generates searchable DeepZoom presentations of Gephi graphs

Primarily maintained by Toke Eskildsen, [toes@kb.dk](mailto:toes@kb.dk), Royal Danish Library


## Requirements

* bash, wget, GraphicsMagic, vips
* SVG exported from Gephi


## Premise
[Gephi](https://gephi.org/) graphs (connected nodes) are hard to visualise at scale in a browser:
Using a vectorised format, such as SVG, serious hardware is required for zoom & pan when the node
count gets into the 10s or 100s of thousands.

graph_presenter is a simple how-to, a small bash script and a bit of JavaScript, which aims to 
produce a DeepZoom bitmap rendering of a SVG from Gephi, presenting it using OpenSeadragon for
seamless zoom & pan on modest hardware. Using the coordinates from the SVG, nodes can be searched
and visually marked through the GUI.


## Demos
* [C64+Amiga domain graph from the Danish net archive](https://labs.statsbiblioteket.dk/linkgraph/c64/) - 57,432 nodes
* ["All" domains from 1998-2003 from the Danish net archive](https://labs.statsbiblioteket.dk/linkgraph/1998_to_2003/) - 79,012 nodes


## How-to
* Generate a graph using Gephi and export is as a SVG.
* Call `./generate_presentation.sh mygraph.svg mypresentation`
* Upload the generated folder `mypresentation` to a webserver or open `mypresentation/index.html` locally

The size of the rendered DeepZoom image can be controlled using `RENDER_SIZE`. The default is 20K pixels, suitable for testing and smaller (5K nodes) graphs. For a large graph with e.g. 100K nodes, something like 50K pixels is better:
```
RENDER_SIZE=50000 ./generate_presentation.sh mygraph.svg mypresentation
```

## De-mystifying
The `./generate_presentation.sh` script is at its core extremely simple:

1. Use GraphicsMagic to convert the SVG to PNG: `gm convert -size 20000x20000 mygraph.svg mygraph.png`
2. Create DeepZoom tiles from the `png`: `vips dzsave mygraph.png mygraph --suffix .png`
3. Extract node-names & coordinates: `tr '\n' ' ' < mygraph.svg | grep -o "<circle [^/]*/>" | sed 's/<circle.* r="\([^"]*\)".* cx="\([^"]*\)".* class="id_\([^"]*\)".* cy="\([^"]*\)".*\/>/\3 \2 \4 \1/' | LC_ALL=C sort`

The JavaScript `domain_control.js` supports search by looking sequentially through all the node-names generated in step #3 and getting their coordinates. For each of these coordinates, an overlay is added to the OpenSeadragon display.


# Notes & to-do
* Rendering in 50K is doable on a 16GB machine, but might take hours. More RAM helps a lot. GraphicsMagic is the bottleneck here. A better scaling SVGâ†’PNG converter would be a welcome addition.
* GraphicsMagic has a problem with kerning for some renders. It should be investigated whether changing fonts could help here.
* Both render-size and font-kerning seems to have been solved for the experimental version of `vips` described in the section below. Direct `vips`-support should be added to the `generate_presentation.sh`-script.

# Adventures with vips

[vips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) excels in handling large images, but due to to [issue 732](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/issues/732) and [issue 1354](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/issues/1354) the current release (2019-07-01) cannot handle large SVGs. Luckily it is simple to compile:
```
git clone `https://github.com/libvips/libvips.git`
cd libvips
git checkout add-unlimited-to-svgload

```
then follow the instructions at [Building libvips from git](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/tree/add-unlimited-to-svgload#building-libvips-from-git). For a specific Ubuntu-version of the instructions, see [Build for Ubuntu / Building from source](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/wiki/Build-for-Ubuntu#building-from-source).

`vips` controls render-size of SVGs with `dpi`, but we can derive that from the input SVG and the wanted size in pixels. If we have `1998_to_2003.svg` and want DeepZoom tiles for a virtual size of 160000x160000 pixels (25 gigapixel), we can do
```
echo $(( 160000 * 72 / $(head -n 100 1998_to_2003.svg | tr '\n' ' ' | grep -o '<svg[^<]*width="[0-9.]*"' | grep -o 'width=.*' | sed 's/[^0-9]*\([0-9]*\)[.].*/\1/') ))
```
For this case it gives us `366` DPI, which we feed to `vips`, together with the `unlimited`-option that allow us to render SVGs larger than 10MB:
```
vips dzsave '1998_to_2003.svg[dpi=366,unlimited]' 1998_to_2003_160K --suffix .png
```
